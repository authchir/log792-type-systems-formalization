\section{Conclusion}

We formalized a number of languages present in \emph{Types and Programming Languages} with the
Isabelle/HOL interactive theorem prover. We started with a simple arithmetic language of booleans
and natural numbers. We continued with the nameless representation of terms for the
$\lambda$-calculus, which we used as a basis for the pure untyped $\lambda$-calculus. For those
languages, we proved the determinacy of evaluation, the relation between values and normal form, the
uniqueness of normal form and the termination, or non-termination, of evaluation.

We then revisited both languages and augment them with type systems. We proved the uniqueness of
types and the safety of the languages through the progress and preservation theorems. We also
demonstrated that the addition of types did not changed the semantic of the $\lambda$-calculus by
proving that types can be erase without affecting the evaluation of terms.

The formalization process can be separate in three main activies: defining the primitives,
formulating the theorems and finally the proving per se. In retrospective, the first and second
activities were the more important and difficult. Once the right abstractions and the correct
formulations for theorems were found, the proofs were usually fairly simple. On the contrary, a
wrong abstraction or hypothesis have led use to theorems very difficult to prove, or even properties
that ended not being theorems at all.

In this report, we focused our attention on the definitions on how theorems were expressed,
highlighting the differences with the book. The complete Isabelle/HOL theories provided along this
report contain more examples, exercices and less important theorems.
